# Internal Docs

This repository is for development of the plugins/theme for the BC Government EAO/EMPR internal documentation website. It is built on wordpress and hosted on openshift, with (in the near future) webhooks to kick off a new build automatically.

For information on how to contribute, contact the author or see the post on the docs site (internal use only).
